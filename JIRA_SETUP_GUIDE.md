This document provides complete setup instructions for integrating Jira with your Backstage IDP for ticket tracking and issue management.

## üéØ Features

- **Issue Management**: View, create, edit, and update Jira issues
- **Project Support**: Filter issues by project and status
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh and sync with Jira data
- **Comment System**: Add comments to existing issues

## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up the Jira integration, ensure you have:

1. **Jira Instance**: Access to a Jira instance (Jira Cloud or Server)
2. **Administrative Access**: Ability to create API tokens and configure permissions
3. **Backstage IDP**: A running Backstage instance with the plugins installed

## üîß Jira Setup (Outside Codebase)

### Step 1: Create a Jira API Token

1. **Login to Jira**:
   - Go to your Jira instance (e.g., `https://your-company.atlassian.net`)
   - Login with your account

2. **Access Account Settings**:
   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
   - Select "Account settings" or "Manage account"

3. **Generate API Token**:
   - Go to the "Security" tab
   - Click on "Create and manage API tokens"
   - Click "Create API token"
   - Give it a descriptive name like "Backstage Integration"
   - Copy the generated token (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Configure Jira Permissions

1. **Project Permissions**:
   - Ensure your user account has the following permissions in the projects you want to integrate:
     - Browse Projects
     - Create Issues
     - Edit Issues
     - Add Comments
     - Assign Issues
     - Transition Issues

2. **Global Permissions** (if needed):
   - For organization-wide integration, ensure your account has:
     - Browse Users and Groups
     - View Project Details

### Step 3: Identify Your Jira Configuration

Collect the following information:
- **Base URL**: Your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://your-company.atlassian.net`)
- **Email**: The email address associated with your Jira account
- **API Token**: The token generated in Step 1

## üöÄ Backstage Configuration

### Step 1: Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file in the Backstage root directory:

\`\`\`bash
# Jira Integration
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-company.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Update app-config.yaml

The Jira configuration is already added to your `app-config.yaml`. Verify it looks like this:

\`\`\`yaml
# Jira integration configuration
jira:
  baseUrl: "\${JIRA_BASE_URL}" # e.g., https://your-company.atlassian.net
  email: "\${JIRA_EMAIL}"      # Your Jira email address
  apiToken: "\${JIRA_API_TOKEN}" # Your Jira API token
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

The plugins have been added to your workspace. Run the following to ensure all dependencies are installed:

\`\`\`bash
yarn install
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Start Backstage

Start your Backstage instance:

\`\`\`bash
yarn start
\`\`\`

   - Restart Backstage after configuration changes

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging for the Jira plugin:

1. **Backend Logs**:
   - Check the backend console for Jira API request/response logs
   - Look for error messages related to Jira connectivity

2. **Frontend Logs**:
